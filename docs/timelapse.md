# Time Lapse Photography With A Pi

A single-board computer running Linux, like the Raspberry Pi, can take time lapses using its on-board camera, or using a USB camera attached. For the Pi, these two approaches require two different applications.

## Use the Built-In Camera and raspistill
If you're using the Pi cam, then you can use the raspistill app to take photos. There is an [intro to raspicam on the Raspberry Pi site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/) that's very good. There's also a page on [using raspistill to make time lapses](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/timelapse.md).

The advantage to using the built-in camera is that it's fast, and the Raspberry Pi foundation has put a lot of work into making the camera interface usable. I'm also quite fond of the Pi Zero case that has a built-in camera mount on the lid. The disadvantage is that the Pi cameras tend to be a bit more expensive than other camera options. You can also use other cameras that use the same interface with other cameras. 

## Use a USB Camera and fswebcam
If you're using an external USB camera, you won't be able to use raspistill, but you can use another app. The Raspberry Pi site has a good [tutorial on using an external USB camera with fswebcam](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/webcams/).

The advantage of using a USB camera is that you can get cheap ones, and they come with a variety of different features. The disadvantage is that you're on your own if they don't work with the built-in drivers.

## Automating The Time Lapse with a Cron Job
To automate your time lapse, you will need to configure the Pi using a cron jobs. cron is a tool that lets you automate tasks on all POSIX computers, including Linux andÂ Unix (including MacOS) computers.

## Stitching The Photos together with ffmpeg
The approaches above both result in a directory full of still images. To create a video from them, you need a tool to stitch these images together into a video. You can do it on a Pi, but the processing power of a Pi is probably much less than your personal computer. 

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is a useful command line video to do this. Transfer the directory of images from your Pi to your personal computer, then open a command line interface and change directories to the image directory. Once you're there, enter the following command:

````
ffmpeg -r 30 -f image2 -s 1920x1080 -i image%04d.jpg -vcodec libx264 -crf 25  -pix_fmt yuv420p video.mp4
````

This assumes the following: 

* You have a directory of images all called `imageXXXX.jpg`, where XXXX is a 4-digit number, and they're all in sequence. The` -i` flag sets your input for the command;
* The images are all 1920x1080, or you want the video that way. the `-s` flag sets the size.
* You want a frame rate of 30 frames per second. the `-r` flag sets this.
* You want to use the H.264 codec. THe `-vcodec` flag sets this.
* You want good quality. the `-crf` flag (constant rate factor) sets this. 0 is lossless compression, 51 is really bad quality, but small file size.
* Your pixel format is [yuv420p](http://softpixel.com/~cwright/programming/colorspace/yuv/). the `-pix_fmt` flag sets this.

The command will output a video file called `video.mp4`.

If your images are all not rotated quite right, you can rotate them using the rotate filter:

````
-vf "rotate=degrees*PI/180"
````

Replace `degrees` above with a rotation value in degrees. Negative numbers are counterclockwise rotation, and positive are clockwise. So to rotate all images counterclockwise by 2 degrees:

````
ffmpeg -r 30 -f image2 -s 1920x1080 -i image%04d.jpg -vf "rotate=-2*PI/180" -vcodec libx264 -crf 25  -pix_fmt yuv420p video.mp4
````

Hammad Mazhar's page on [stitching photos together with ffmpeg](http://hamelot.io/visualization/using-ffmpeg-to-convert-a-set-of-images-into-a-video/) is a good summary of how to do it. They cover a number of additional techniques such as start and end frames, converting from other formats, etc.
